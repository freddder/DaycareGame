# The Plan

I needed to find a way to store the necessary data for evey single Pokemon species. Things like egg groups, gender ratio and different forms to make sure I could simulate how breeding works in the main games. In the end I decided to include every Pokemon up to Gen VII (Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon) with a few modifications.

# Why

I decided very early that I wanted to pick a single generation of games to base the entirety of my data so I could keep the mechanics consistent from mon to mon and not worry too much about balancing as well as keeping faithful to the original games. Things like the curently existing moves, abilities, regional forms, etc.

I went with Gen VII because it was the last generation to have every single species data updated to the game's mechanics and the futher I go from Gen V, more Pokemon will have unoficial 2D sprites and they won't be animated.

Obviously this isn't a perfectly clean solution, so I had to make some small modifications to some species to make sure they are compatible with the type of game I want to make. An example is changing how you evolve all Pokemon that normaly would require trading. A list of all changes can be found [here](#changes).

# How

Pokemon and their data are organized in the `assets/pokemon/species` folder by their National Pokedex number (e.g.: 0001 is Bulbasaur and 0150 is Mewtwo). Inside each folder, you can find a `json` file that contains all the data for that specific Pokemon and its texture assets.

The `json` data files are generated by the `generate-species-files.py` python script by making requests to [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Species

| :---- | :----: | :---- |
| **data_version** | `int` | Used to check if C++ is on the same version (current version: **4**) |
| **name** | `string` | Species' display name |

## Evolution
Every variable represents a check (except **dex_num**). In order to evolve, all checks must pass
| Variable name | Type | Description |

| **ability_2** | `int` | ID for second possible ability ( 0 for no second ability) |
| **hidden_ability** | `int` | ID for hidden ability ( 0 for no hidden ability) |
| **base_hp** | `int` | Base stat's HP |

# Changes

All Pokemon that required trading to evolve will instead evolve usgin the Linking Cord item like in the Pokemom Legends: Arceus game. This includes:
- Kadabra
- Machoke
- Graveler
- Haunter
- Boldore
- Gurdurr
- Karrablast
- Shelmet
- Phantump
- Pumpkaboo

All Pokemon that had to hold and item while being traded will now evolve when you use their original trade item. This includes:
- Poliwhirl to Politoed
- Slowpoke to Slowking
- Onix
- Scyther to Scizor
- Seadra
- Porygon
- Porygon2
- Clamperl
- Rhydon
- Electabuzz
- Magmar
- Dusclops
- Feebas
- Spritzee
- Swirlix

All Pokemon that required to level up on a specific location during Gen VII now evolve with their corresponding evolutionary stone like they normally do in Gen VIII or later. This includes:
- Magneton
- Eevee to Leafeon
- Eevee to Glaceon
- Nosepass
- Charjabug
- Crabrawler

To match other Pokemon method for evolving, Eevee now needs to learn Baby Doll Eyes specificaly in order to evolve into Sylveon instead of any fairy move (just to make my life easier). Besides, it could only learn 2 fairy moves anyway (the other being Charm) and Baby Doll Eyes is the easiest to learn.
